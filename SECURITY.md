## Reporting a Vulnerability

Unlike other bugs or issues I recommend not creating a public Issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please reach out to me at [annotated-container-security@me.cspray.io](annotated-container-security@me.cspray.io) with details of your discovery. It would be beneficial if you created a **private** GitHub repository with relevant code and tests describing the flaw.

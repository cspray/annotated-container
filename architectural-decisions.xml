    <contents><![CDATA[# Allow Single Entrypoint for ContainerDefinitionBuilderContextConsumer

## Context

A ContainerDefinitionBuilderContextConsumer is primarily intended to support adding third-party services that can't
be annotated to a ContainerDefinition. It could be beneficial to attach multiple consumers so that complex third-party
service setup does not have to happen entirely in 1 implementation.

## Decision

We explicitly only allow one ContainerDefinitionBuilderContextConsumer to be configured when compiling your
ContainerDefinition.

It would be technically possible, and even straightforward, to allow configuring multiple context consumers. However,
doing so would have a significant cognitive overhead and, potentially, cause what services are used in a given
situation to be vague or unclear. Specifically, third-party packages could provide a context consumer that overrides
your definitions without you being fully aware of it.

If you need to use multiple consumers or consumers implemented by third-parties then you're required to provide your
own entrypoint and compose them together or explicitly define which third-party consumer you'd like to use. This way
you know precisely what code is determining the services for your application.]]></contents>

    <contents><![CDATA[# Configuration instances cannot be assigned profiles

## Context

Configuration instances are classes with properties that can have arbitrary values injected into them with the
#[Inject] Attribute. Like a Service, Configuration instances are shared with the Container. Unlike a Service,
Configuration cannot be assigned an explicit profile.

## Decision

We explicitly do no allow setting a profile on a Configuration. The Configuration is meant to use #[Inject] Attributes
to define values. Any value that should only be injected when certain profiles are active should have that reflected
in the #[Inject] Attribute. This way just 1 Configuration instance is required and any profile-specific values are
defined on the value itself.]]></contents>
